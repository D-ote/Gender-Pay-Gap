### Introduction
The gender pay gap is a significant issue that persists globally, with women often earning less than men for performing similar work. This report presents an analysis of gender pay gap data from the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). [The dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qih5qBcuTntLbx7G7BzunRSOgGD0b_zc07sTzqiKGn4/edit#gid=1275614270) includes information on annual salaries for both women and men, pay differences in amounts and percentages, and explores various job categories to identify trends and disparities. The findings from this analysis have been summarized into an interactive dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dooter.ior/viz/GenderPayGapUS-UK/Dashboard1).

### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to explore and understand the gender pay gap in the US and UK job markets. Specifically, the objectives are:

- To identify jobs with the largest and smallest pay differences between genders.
- To examine cases where women are paid more than their male colleagues.
- To quantify and analyze the overall gender pay gap in the dataset.
- To provide insights and recommendations for addressing gender pay disparities.

### Research Questions
To achieve the objectives outlined above, the following research questions were addressed:

- What are the jobs with the largest gender pay differences in both countries?
- Are there any notable cases where women earn more than men in specific occupations?
- What is the overall magnitude of the gender pay gap in the dataset?
- What factors contribute to the observed gender pay disparities?

### Data Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure data quality and consistency:

- Missing data: There were no missing values in the dataset
- Outlier detection: Outliers in salary data were detected and investigated to determine their validity
- Feature engineering: new columns were created to aid with the analysis
- Changing data types

### Analysis and Findings
- Jobs with Largest Pay Differences: The analysis revealed that certain occupations, such as executive-level positions (e.g., CEOs, CFOs) and specialized medical roles (e.g., surgeons), exhibited the largest pay differences between genders. These discrepancies were often attributed to factors such as male dominance in leadership roles and gender biases in salary negotiations.
- Jobs with Smallest Pay Differences: Conversely, occupations in fields like education and healthcare demonstrated smaller gender pay gaps, indicating relatively more equitable compensation structures.
- Cases of Women Earning More: Although relatively rare, instances were identified where women earned more than their male counterparts, particularly in roles where women are traditionally underrepresented but highly valued (e.g., IT directors, police officers, drivers).

### Recommendations
Based on the findings of this analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to address the gender pay gap:

- Implement proactive measures to promote pay equity, such as conducting regular salary audits and establishing transparent salary structures.
- Encourage diversity and inclusion initiatives to increase representation of women in higher-paying roles and leadership positions.
- Provide training and support for salary negotiation skills to empower women to negotiate fair compensation.
- Advocate for policy changes at the organizational and governmental levels to enforce equal pay legislation and combat gender-based discrimination in the workplace.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of gender pay gap data in the US and UK highlights persistent disparities in earnings between men and women across various job categories. By understanding the underlying factors contributing to these disparities and implementing targeted interventions, organizations and policymakers can work towards achieving greater pay equity and fostering inclusive work environments.

### Limitations and Future Research
It's important to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis, including potential biases in the dataset, limitations of available data sources, and the complexity of factors contributing to the gender pay gap. Future research could explore additional dimensions of the gender pay gap, such as intersectionality with race and ethnicity, as well as longitudinal analyses to track changes in pay disparities over time.

Overall, this analysis contributes to the ongoing dialogue on gender equality in the workforce and underscores the need for concerted efforts to address and mitigate the gender pay gap.
